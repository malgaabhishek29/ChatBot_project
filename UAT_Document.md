| TC-01       | Validate bot startup             | Run `node index.js`                       | Bot logs in and displays “Bot logged in as Sample Chat Bot” | Bot started successfully    | ✅ Pass     |
| TC-02       | Verify “ping” message response   | In Discord channel, type `ping`           | Bot replies “pong ✅ (listener working)”                     | Responded correctly         | ✅ Pass     |
| TC-03       | Verify custom prefix command     | In Discord channel, type `!chat hello`    | Bot replies “I heard you: 'hello'”                          | Responded correctly         | ✅ Pass     |
| TC-04       | Test message filter              | Send random text not matching any command | Bot ignores the message                                     | Bot ignored irrelevant text | ✅ Pass     |

---

## 5) Observed Behavior

* The bot successfully handled both **prefix commands** (`!chat`) and **plain message triggers** (`ping`).
* Responses were instantaneous (< 1 second).
* No errors, rate limits, or disconnects were observed during the test session.

---

## 6) Post-Conditions

* Bot remains online and responsive after multiple message triggers.
* Verified that all registered slash commands appear under `/` in Discord.
